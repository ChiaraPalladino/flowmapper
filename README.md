QGIS FlowMapper (by Cem GULLUOGLU)

Plugin can generate Net/Gross/TwoWay flow lines based and also the flow nodes based on an interaction matrix and a pair of coordinates supplied in plain text (txt) format. 
All outputs are in shapefile format. Flow and node filtering capabilities are available as well as graduated symbology options.
